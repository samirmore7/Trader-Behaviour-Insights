# Trader-Behaviour-Insights
This project analyzes how market sentiment affects trader behavior and performance using historical trading data and Fear-Greed sentiment index.

Methodology

Data cleaning and validation

Timestamp alignment and merging datasets

Feature engineering: PnL, win rate, trade size, leverage proxy

Sentiment-based performance analysis

Trader segmentation based on leverage, frequency, and consistency

Key Insights

Traders perform better during Extreme Greed sentiment conditions

Traders increase leverage and trade size during Fear periods

High-leverage and infrequent traders generate higher average PnL

Strategy Recommendations

Introduce leverage limits during Fear sentiment to reduce risk exposure

Encourage selective high-conviction trades rather than frequent trading

Implement behavior-based risk controls for different trader segments

How to Run

Open the notebook in Jupyter/Colab and run cells sequentially.
